            <h3>Code for Canada Fellow</h3>
            <p>
                From November 2020 to August 2021, I took part in a <a href="https://codefor.ca/fellowship" target="_blank">
                Code for Canada fellowship</a>
                as a Developer Fellow.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Code for Canada fellowship is a 10-month program that embeds small, agile teams of digital professionals 
                into government departments to improve public digital services.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was assigned to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), where I worked on a team with a product manger and UX designer 
                along with a core team of four public servants. Our goal was to make it easier for the public to participate in 
                hearings so that they could more effectively contribute their voices to matters of energy adjudication. We did this 
                by redesigning the CER's participation web interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                This opportunity was a tremendous learning experience which involved working in a fast-paced environment to do everything from 
                organizational discovery, user research, solution design, and prototyping to working with the CER's IT team 
                to implement our product. I had to quickly go from never having programmed in C# to working in the ASP.NET MVC framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time at the CER, I also had the opportunity to deliver a workshop about web accessibility to the Digital Transformation Team.
                <a href="https://codefor.ca/blog/how-to-design-and-develop-for-web-accessibility-a-workshop-summary/" target="_blank">I wrote a blog post about it.</a>

            <h3>Engineering Intern at Hansen Technologies</h3>
            <p>
                From September 2018 to August 2019 I worked as an 
                Engineering Intern at Sigma Systems, now <a href="https://www.hansencx.com" target="_blank">Hansen Technologies</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on the user interface for the product now called 
                <a href="https://www.hansencx.com/hansen-create-deliver-engage-suite/communications/hansen-provision" target="_blank">Hansen Provision</a>.
                This user interface was implemented using React, MobX, TypeScript, and Bootstrap 3.  At one point I proposed and implemented a refactor which 
                improved maintainability and saved over 1600 lines of code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I created an internal e-learning course about 
                how Docker works to help bridge an understanding gap 
                between technical and non-technical employees.
