                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    While most of the skills listed below are framed in 
                    relation to web development, my computer science education 
                    and programming experience make me a suitable candidate for 
                    any entry-level software development position.
                </p>
                <h3>General Development Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I have used <b>Git</b> and <b>GNU/Linux</b> extensively, 
                    and I am proficient in standard GNU/Linux <b>command 
                    line tools</b> and <b>BASH scripting</b>. I have a solid 
                    grasp of standard <b>data structures</b> and 
                    <b>algorithms</b>. 
                    I am familiar with <b>object-oriented design</b> and 
                    programming and have used these extensively. Finally, I am 
                    familiar with <b>agile development</b> methodologies.
                </p>
                <h3>Front-End Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to a strong command of the web fundamentals 
                    (<b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>CSS</b>), I have 
                    experience writing websites and web applications using 
                    frameworks and other tools such as <b>React</b>, 
                    <b>SCSS</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>Bootstrap</b>. 
                    <b>Responsive design</b> is second-nature to me, and I am  
                    familiar with the theory and practice of making 
                    <b>accessible</b> websites.
                </p>
                <h3>Back-End Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I have implemented web application backends using 
                    <b>Node.js</b> and the <b>Express</b> server framework. I 
                    have implemented a <b>MongoDB</b> database as the backend 
                    for a web app using <b>Mongoose</b> for object modelling. 
                    Additionally, I wrote significant amounts of <b>SQL</b>, 
                    <b>Python</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>Java</b> code during my 
                    time in university. I also have some familiarity with 
                    <b>Docker</b> from my internship.
                </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the <b>University of Toronto</b> in June 
                    2020. I obtained an <b>Honours Bachelor of Science</b> 
                    with <b>High Distinction</b>, with a double-major in 
                    <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Philosophy.</b> My 
                    <b>GPA was 3.82</b>, and I was given the distinction of 
                    <b>Dean’s List Scholar</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My computer science coursework included topics such as 
                    data structures, databases, software design, algorithm 
                    design and analysis, operating systems, and web 
                    development.
                    In my philosophy major I focused on formal logic, ethics, 
                    and the philosophy of mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time at university I was awarded the following 
                    scholarships and awards:

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    From September 2018 to August 2019 I worked as an 
                    Engineering Intern at 
                    <a href="https://sigma-systems.com/">Sigma Systems</a> 
                    (now Hansen Technologies)
                    as part of the University of Toronto’s Professional 
                    Experience Year program. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bulk of my time here was spent working on a front-end 
                    web application written using React, MobX, TypeScript, and 
                    Bootstrap 3. I wrote real code set to go into production; 
                    this was not an intern project. I worked under a more 
                    experienced developer who delegated features and other 
                    tasks such as POCs which I then implemented on my own. At 
                    one point I proposed and implemented a refactor which saved 
                    over 1600 lines of code and improved maintainability and 
                    extensibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before that, I created an internal E-Learning course about 
                    how Docker works to help bridge an understanding gap 
                    between technical and non-technical employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some additional experiences I had working at Sigma 
                    include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            completing courses in information security and 
                            secure development practices
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            working with enterprise-level software development 
                            practices (e.g. using a more advanced source 
                            control system involving Git, Gerrit, and Jenkins)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            working on an agile team with daily standups
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
