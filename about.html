        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            While most of the skills listed below are framed in 
            relation to web development, my computer science education 
            and programming experience make me a suitable candidate for 
            any entry-level software development position.
        </p>
        <h3>General Development Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I have used <b>Git</b> and <b>GNU/Linux</b> extensively, 
            and I am proficient in standard GNU/Linux <b>command 
            line tools</b> and <b>BASH scripting</b>. I have a solid 
            grasp of standard <b>data structures</b> and 
            <b>algorithms</b>. 
            I am familiar with <b>object-oriented design</b> and 
            programming and have used these extensively. Finally, I am 
            familiar with <b>agile development</b> methodologies.
        </p>
        <h3>Front-End Skills</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to a strong command of the web fundamentals 
            (<b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>), I have 
            experience writing websites and web applications using 
            frameworks and other tools such as <b>React</b>, 
            <b>SCSS</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>, and <b>Bootstrap</b>. 
            <b>Responsive design</b> is second-nature to me, and I am  
            familiar with the theory and practice of making 
            <b>accessible</b> websites.
        </p>
        <h3>Back-End Skills</h3>
        <p>
            I have implemented web application backends using 
            <b>Node.js</b> and the <b>Express</b> server framework. I 
            have implemented a <b>MongoDB</b> database as the backend 
            for a web app using <b>Mongoose</b> for object modelling. 
            Additionally, I wrote significant amounts of <b>SQL</b>, 
            <b>Python</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>Java</b> code during my 
            time in university. I also have some familiarity with 
            <b>Docker</b> from my internship.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from the <b>University of Toronto</b> in June 
            2020. I obtained an <b>Honours Bachelor of Science</b> 
            with <b>High Distinction</b>, with a double-major in 
            <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Philosophy.</b> My 
            <b>GPA was 3.82</b>, and I was given the distinction of 
            <b>Dean’s List Scholar</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My computer science coursework included topics such as 
            data structures, databases, software design, algorithm 
            design and analysis, operating systems, and web 
            development.
            In my philosophy major I focused on formal logic, ethics, 
            and the philosophy of mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at university I was awarded the following 
            scholarships and awards:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    St. Michael's College Silver Medal
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lawrence E. Lynch In-Course Scholarship in

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            From September 2018 to August 2019 I worked as an 
            Engineering Intern at 
            <a href="https://sigma-systems.com/">Sigma Systems</a> 
            (now Hansen Technologies)
            as part of the University of Toronto’s Professional 
            Experience Year program. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The bulk of my time here was spent working on a front-end 
            web application written using React, MobX, TypeScript, and 
            Bootstrap 3. I wrote real code set to go into production; 
            this was not an intern project. I worked under a more 
            experienced developer who delegated features and other 
            tasks such as POCs which I then implemented on my own. At 
            one point I proposed and implemented a refactor which saved 
            over 1600 lines of code and improved maintainability and 
            extensibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I created an internal E-Learning course about 
            how Docker works to help bridge an understanding gap 
            between technical and non-technical employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some additional experiences I had working at Sigma 
            include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    completing courses in information security and 
                    secure development practices
                </li>
                <li>
                    working with enterprise-level software development 
                    practices (e.g. using a more advanced source 
                    control system involving Git, Gerrit, and Jenkins)
                </li>
                <li>
                    working on an agile team with daily standups
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
