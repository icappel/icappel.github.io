                        This web app lets your report and query dangerous drivers. I made this to practice using AWS in preparation for my

                        The backend is serverless, with an API implemented using API Gateway and Lambda manipulating data in 
                        DynamoDB. The frontend is made with React and TypeScript.

                        I track my personal tasks using a service called <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank">Todoist</a>.
                        At one point, I started wishing their product would let me see what my upcoming week or so would look like 
                        by viewing tasks in a calendar type view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned that this wasn't on their roadmap, so I took things into my own hands one weekend morning and 
                        looked up the Todoist API. I spent an hour or two throwing this together. 
                        Despite being quick and rough-around-the-edges, this is one of the projects I'm most proud of 
                        since I actually use this little tool almost every day.

                        If you're anything like me, you sometimes end 
                        up wondering how you got to where you are after 
                        reading Wikipedia for awhile. I thought it might 
                        be interesting to view this using the implicit
                        tree-like structure created by opening multiple 
                        articles in new tabs.

                        This project is a work in progress. Currently 
                        the trees are built up in a custom data 
                        structure before being translated to the 
                        structure required by 
                        <a href="https://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/">Treant.js</a>
                        for drawing. The images and human-readable 
                        article titles are fetched using the 
                        <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> 
                        API.

                        I originally made this website in plain HTML files in a bout of purism.
                        I've since converted it to Jekyll and now it's much more maintainable.

                        While not super technically-sophisticated, this 
                        project did involve setting up a PayPal button, a bit 
                        of DNS wrangling, and getting a business 
                        license in the province of Ontario!
