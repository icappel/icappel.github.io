                        An online newsletter for people who don't like 
                        the news.

                        While not super technically-sophisticated, this 
                        project did involve setting up a PayPal button, a bit 
                        of DNS wrangling, and getting a business 
                        license in the province of Ontario!

                        If you're anything like me, you sometimes end 
                        up wondering how you got to where you are after 
                        reading Wikipedia for awhile. I thought it might 
                        be interesting to view this using the implicit
                        tree-like structure created by opening multiple 
                        articles in new tabs.

                        This project is a work in progress. Currently 
                        the trees are built up in a custom data 
                        structure before being translated to the 
                        structure required by 
                        <a href="https://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/">Treant.js</a>
                        for drawing. The images and human-readable 
                        article titles are fetched using the 
                        <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> 
                        API.
